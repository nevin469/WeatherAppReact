# Background
In Aug 2021, I created a weather application to help users determine the weather at any location around the world without internet access. So, the application fetches the weather data from a website called openweathermap.org where it records the weather data and the app displays the results from the website. The application works by users searching from the search bar I implemeted and the results display the date, temperature, weather location with the country it is from and weather statuses like raining. A cool implementation is that the background changes color based on the temperature. For example if the temperature is above 16째C, the background will change to a warm looking image. Otherwise, the background will change to a cold looking image if the temperature is below 16째C. Attached below are the technologies I used and images of the application running with both hot and cold tempatures.
